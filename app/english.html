<p><b>Immersed in this music as I
painted,</b> l felt it flow through me physically and found myself expressing both
the movement of the music and my own emotions in free and spontaneous brush
strokes that are musical as well as gestural. <br></p><p><b>Chile, the country where
I was born and where I developed my artistic career<span>, is firmly recorded in my memory.&nbsp;</span></b>The colors I have used suggest -in an abstract way-, my memories of the
geography, the forest, the desert, the ocean, and the Chilean sky.</p>

<p>Those
memories are meshed with both the&nbsp;experiences I had&nbsp;in my many
travels to Spain to connect with my father’s&nbsp;ancestral roots and also
with&nbsp;my experience&nbsp;in the United States&nbsp;where I have lived
for&nbsp;almost fifteen years&nbsp;and where I&nbsp;continue to develop&nbsp;an
artistic vision formed by <b>my multi-cultural experiences.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img src="https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167513/files/20150122115150-15-Mi_Antigua_Tierra_XV_Sugerencias_Chile_2_Jorge_Urrutia_Blondel_SM.jpg?1421956310" style="max-width: 620px;"></p>My Ancient Land, “Suggestions of Chile II” | 2014 | acrylic on canvas | 11”x 16.5” (28x 42cm) Inspired by composer Jorge Urrutia * In traveling exhibition<div><br><div><p></p>

<p><b>The
resultant&nbsp;paintings&nbsp;</b>–some of them of big dimensions- serve as&nbsp;coded maps,&nbsp;leading
the viewer to the Illo Tempore where, over time, <b>we are part of a&nbsp;universal
root system </b>without
cultural, territorial, or continental distinctions.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p><b>This
journey toward universal origins intrigues me</b>, and it spontaneously appears in my work.</p><p><br></p><p></p>

<h3><b><b>About
the artist</b></b></h3>
<p></p>



<p><b>Jacqueline Unanue</b> was born in Chile, and studied design at the
Universidad de Chile de Valparaíso. At that time she became interested in
pre-Columbian art, especially the rock art done in her native country. She met
archaeologist Hans Niemeyer, the most important scholar of Chilean rock art,
who became her mentor.</p>
<p>Together with her husband
Ricardo Guajardo, who is also a designer and graphic artist, Unanue traveled
extensively through Chile’s Atacama Desert, doing on-site research in the
mountains and cliff areas that contain art that was carved or painted thousands
of years ago. She also traveled to Spain to study the pre-historic paintings of
the Altamira caves in the Basque Country, which being the home of her paternal
ancestors connected her to her roots.</p><p>She won the Critics Award in
Visual Arts by the Association of Art Critics, Valparaiso, Chile. Twice she has
obtained grant funds DIRAC, Department of Cultural Affairs, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Chile for her exhibitions in Guayasamin Foundation, Quito, Ecuador,
in 1996 and the Inter-American Development Bank Gallery in Washington DC, in
2000. </p>
<p>Obtuvo el Premio de la
Crítica en Artes Visuales de la Asociación de Críticos de Arte de Valparaíso en
Chile. Dos veces ha recibido el auspicio de DIRAC Direción de Asuntos
Culturales, del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, para sus exposiones en la
Fundación Guayasamín, Quito, Ecuador, en 1996 y en el BID, Banco Interamericano
de Desarrollo, en Washington DC, en el&nbsp;
2000.</p>


<p>In addition to numerous
individual and group exhibitions in Chile since 1983, she has also been
exhibited in Spain, Finland, Ecuador, Argentina, and the United States—in
galleries in Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York. </p>
<p>Since
her arrival in the United States in 2000, her artistic vision has mainly been
expressed through abstract acrylic painting on canvas. She is represented by
the 3<sup>rd</sup> Street Gallery, Philadelphia, PA, USA:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3rdstreetgallery.com/">http://www.3rdstreetgallery.com/</a></p>

<b><b>Risks</b></b><br>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are certainly some
risks involved for me on the trips and for you supporting me! But they are
challenges that I'm ready to face and will lead.</p>
<p><b>If I don't reach my goal:</b> This would present a real challenge,&nbsp;<b>but</b>&nbsp;it wouldn't mean discarding this
project.&nbsp;Because I'm using the flexible funding option on Indiegogo, I can
still keep most of what I do raise, and then I would have to work really hard
and be really creative about other ways to earn money. </p>
<p>If all else failed for the
time being, your contributions would be&nbsp;<b>carefully laid aside to go
toward other artistic opportunities</b>&nbsp;when
they arise.&nbsp;For sure I would keep you informed.</p>
<p>I am a proactive both as an
artist and as a person, and I think this attitude can help guide me through all
the above challenges and many others, but I do&nbsp;<b>need your encouragement
and support</b>&nbsp;enormously as I
take on this new adventure!&nbsp;</p>
<br><p><b></b></p><b><h3><b>Thank
you very much for your interest and support!</b></h3></b><p></p>
